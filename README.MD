# chicken server

- `functions` - Code for the application's Lambda functions.
- `template.yaml` - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

## Deploy the application

To use the AWS SAM CLI, you need the following tools:

- AWS SAM CLI - [Install the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).
- Node.js - [Install Node.js 16](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the npm package management tool.
- Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community).

To build and deploy the application:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy
```

The API Gateway endpoint API will be displayed in the outputs when the deployment is complete.

## Running Locally

Ensure dynamodb docker image is running.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

DynamoDB must be created and have the tables created.
// TODO: add script for table created locally

```bash
aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

```bash
aws dynamodb create-table --table-name SampleTable --attribute-definitions 'AttributeName=partitionKey,AttributeType=S' 'AttributeName=sortKey,AttributeType=S' --key-schema 'AttributeName=partitionKey,KeyType=HASH' 'AttributeName=sortKey,KeyType=RANGE' --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

Create a default menu

```bash
aws dynamodb batch-write-item --request-items file://menu.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

Build your application by using the `sam build` command.

```bash
sam build
```

Use the `sam local start-api` command to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
sam local start-api --template template.yaml --docker-network lambda-local --skip-pull-image -n env.json
curl http://localhost:3000/
```

View dynamodb tables by going to [here](http://localhost:8001/)

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, the AWS SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs that are generated by your Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

**NOTE:** This command works for all Lambda functions, not just the ones you deploy using AWS SAM.

```bash
my-application$ sam logs -n putItemFunction --stack-name sam-app --tail
```

**NOTE:** This uses the logical name of the function within the stack. This is the correct name to use when searching logs inside an AWS Lambda function within a CloudFormation stack, even if the deployed function name varies due to CloudFormation's unique resource name generation.

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [AWS SAM CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Unit tests

Tests are defined in the `functions/*/tests` folder in this project. Use NPM to install the [Mocha test framework](https://mochajs.org/) and run unit tests.

```bash
sam-app$ cd functions/stock-checker
stock-checker$ npm install
stock-checker$ npm run test
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name bcs-app
```
