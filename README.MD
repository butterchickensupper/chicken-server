- `src` - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- `events` - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- `__tests__` - Unit tests for the application code.
- `template.yaml` - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

## Deploy the application

To use the AWS SAM CLI, you need the following tools:

- AWS SAM CLI - [Install the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).
- Node.js - [Install Node.js 16](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the npm package management tool.
- Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community).

To build and deploy the application:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy
```

The API Gateway endpoint API will be displayed in the outputs when the deployment is complete.

## Running Locally

Ensure dynamodb docker image is running.

```bash
npm run start-dynamo
```

DynamoDB must be created and have the tables created.
// TODO: add script for table created locally

```bash
aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

```bash
aws dynamodb create-table --table-name SampleTable --attribute-definitions 'AttributeName=id,AttributeType=S' --key-schema 'AttributeName=id,KeyType=HASH' --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

Create a default menu

```bash
aws dynamodb batch-write-item --request-items file://menu.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
```

Build your application by using the `npm run build` command.

```bash
my-application$ npm run build
```

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
my-application$ sam local invoke putItemFunction --event events/event-post-item.json
my-application$ sam local invoke getAllItemsFunction --event events/event-get-all-items.json
```

Use the `npm run start` command to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
my-application$ npm run start
my-application$ curl http://localhost:3000/
```

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, the AWS SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs that are generated by your Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

**NOTE:** This command works for all Lambda functions, not just the ones you deploy using AWS SAM.

```bash
my-application$ sam logs -n putItemFunction --stack-name sam-app --tail
```

**NOTE:** This uses the logical name of the function within the stack. This is the correct name to use when searching logs inside an AWS Lambda function within a CloudFormation stack, even if the deployed function name varies due to CloudFormation's unique resource name generation.

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [AWS SAM CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Unit tests

Tests are defined in the `__tests__` folder in this project. Use `npm` to install the [Jest test framework](https://jestjs.io/) and run unit tests.

```bash
my-application$ npm install
my-application$ npm run test
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name bcs-app
```
